#Coursera-DataScience
At SFU, I studied MIS and Business Analytics. While courses are usually structured around using proprietary software that is "common" in the "industry", I thought that what is taught in class is definitely not enough.
Whether in statistics or in programming/computer science, the knowledge-bases are deep with lots more to learn!
 
Perhaps that is what draws me to statistics and analytics. 
There are always things to learn, be it in the techniques, findings and even the implications.
Moreover, it is always required to be inquisitive and curious. Afterall, every analysis begins with a question! (hypothesis)
To furter build my skillsets, I decided to go through the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience) offered by Coursera and John Hopkins University.

####Overview of the Courses Taken and Program
- [x] Data Scientist's Toolbox
- [x] R Programming
- [ ] Getting and Cleaning Data
- [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] Reproducible Research
- [ ] Statistical Inference
- [ ] Regression Models
- [ ] Practical Machine Learning
- [ ] Developing Data Products
- [ ] Data Science Capstone

The purpose of this repo is really to document all the work I have done. It will also serve as an archive later on in the months which I could look back to and see the growth after completing the program.
In case there are peeps looking for learning resources, the following will also be a list of links of valuable resources that I have gone through.
